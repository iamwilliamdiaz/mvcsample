What you did and why

* Migrated the legacy project to Codeigniter a MVC framework for a easy development and scalability

* Used Twitter Bootstrap for responsiveness.

* Integrated jQuery and Ajax for better usability and server side performance improvement

* Added tokens hash for the patient and song tables to avoid expose primary keys on the view on the ajax calls

* I decided to use a modal windows on the song selection for a better usability.

* Used Bootstrap data tables with data sets mapped to avoid multiples calls to the server when sorting, searching or paginating the data. (Increase performance)


What you would do given more time and a larger budget

* Integrate patients registration
* Admin dashboard to add new admins or new users, block songs, etc
* Every user would have a profile with a song list, favorite artist and songs recommendations
* Social media integration with song selections feeds
* Branding (Logo, Product Name and Theme)
